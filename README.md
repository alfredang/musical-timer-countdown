## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfredang/timer-countdown.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🔊 Sound
To enable sounds, ensure you have `click.mp3`, `start.mp3`, and `alarm.mp3` in the `assets/sounds/` directory. The app falls back to browser-generated beeps if files are missing.
